# Programming Practice Repository 🚀

Welcome to my coding practice hub! This repository is where I solve exercises, implement algorithms, and build small projects across multiple programming languages to sharpen my skills.

## 📌 Languages Covered
- **Python**  
- **C**  
- **Java**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **PHP**  

## 🗂 Repository Structure

├── Python/ # Python exercises & projects
│ ├── exercises/ # Coding challenges 
│ └── projects/ # Mini-projects 
├── C/ # Low-level and algorithmic practice
├── Java/ # OOP and Java-specific concepts
├── JavaScript/ # Web-focused scripts and apps
├── PHP/ # Server-side scripting practice


## � Goals
- Solve **coding challenges** (e.g., arrays, recursion, DP).  
- Build **small projects** to apply concepts (e.g., websites, APIs).  
- Compare implementations **across languages**.  
- Track progress over time.  

## 🔥 How to Navigate
1. **By Language**: Check the respective folder.  
2. **By Topic**: Exercises often include comments or a `README` explaining the problem.  
3. **By Difficulty**: Folders may be split into `easy/`, `medium/`, `hard/`.  

## 📝 Notes
- Code is **commented** for clarity.  
- Solutions may not be optimal—feedback is welcome!  
- Projects will grow in complexity over time.  

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **IDEs**: VS Code, Vim(sometimes) 
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub  
- **Package Managers**: pip, npm, composer
