def encode(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
    return "hello"

def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
    return "hi"


# this is the problem set of encode decode strings of the neetcode 150


# The algorithm we are trying to write is not an algorithm that takes one string and ecodes and decodes it.
# what we are trying to achieve is an algorithm that takes a LIST of strings and encodes it to ONE string.


# first Approach:
